# DAT320

This repository contains our group’s solutions to compulsory assignments and other relevant materials from the Time Series Analysis course at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU).

All exercises are solved using R. The datasets are either provided directly in the assignments or retrieved through external API calls. Solutions are documented and presented in *R Markdown (.Rmd)* and *HTML* formats.

The repository is intended for academic reference and documentation of coursework completed as part of the course.
